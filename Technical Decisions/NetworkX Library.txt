The Python NetworkX library is a package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

Given that the basis for this project revolves around Graphs and their topology, NetworkX seems the best choice for implementing this project.

NetworkX comes with many standard graph algorithms already implemented, including Dijkstra's algorithm which is an important one for the purposes of this project,
especially since the algorithm will be used extensively.
